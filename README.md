# Employee-Tracker
A command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Description
- In this challenge I created a note taking app that is used to write and save notes. This app uses Express.js on the back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

- In this challenge I created a employee database using node.js, express.js, and MySQL.  This allows the user to using the command line to view current department, roles and employees.  The user can also add a department or role.  

The future of this project:
- I plan to complete the add an employee, update employee, and exit.
